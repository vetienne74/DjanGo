Description:
------------
Validation test in homogeneous medium without boundaries
2 points are validated:
- solution against analytical solution
- source consistency (retrieved from computated wavefield)

How to run the tests:
---------------------
- solution against analytical solution
type sh run.sh
use Matlab script check.m

- source consistency (retrieved from computated wavefield)
use Matlab script fdm_1d.m and valid_wave.m
